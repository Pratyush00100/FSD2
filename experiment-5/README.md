# Experiment 5

**Aim:**
To implement performance optimization in a Multi-Page React Application using Dynamic Imports and Lazy Loading.

**Learning Outcomes:**
* Master the concept of Code Splitting to improve initial application load times.
* Implement `React.lazy` for dynamic importing of page components only when required.
* Utilize the `Suspense` component to manage loading states with professional fallback UIs.
* Configure optimized client-side routing to navigate between dynamically loaded views.
* Practice building scalable Single Page Application (SPA) architectures that prioritize speed.
