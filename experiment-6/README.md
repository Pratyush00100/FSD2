# Experiment 6

**Aim:**
To implement robust form handling and schema-based validation in a React application using controlled components and specialized libraries.

**Learning Outcomes:**
* Create **controlled components** where React state serves as the single source of truth for all form inputs.
* Utilize the **React Hook Form** library to efficiently manage complex form states with minimal code.
* Integrate **Yup schema validation** to enforce strict data constraints and handle input errors.
* Implement **file upload handling** with real-time image previews using the `FileReader` API.
* Develop **accessible and professional UIs** that provide clear, immediate feedback and specific error messages to users.
